# Unit 3 Homework - Password Generator

## Description

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they have selected.  The user story was that, as an employee working with sensitive data, I need to randomly generate a password that meets defined critera for a strong password to provide security.

The additional acceptance criteria was as follows:

- WHEN I click the button to generate a password THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

In writting my JavaScript, I utilized objects, functions, if statements, for loops, strings, & alerts.
